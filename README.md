# MemorySpace Features

Small, useful tools extracted from building [MemoryIntelligence](https://github.com/kckassette) - shared as part of my **Build in Public** journey on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/YOUR_LINKEDIN).

## 🔧 Available Features

### [Live Debugger](./live-debugger/) 
A drop-in JavaScript debugging console that tracks all user interactions in real-time.

| What it does | Why you'd want it |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Logs every click, input, keyboard event | See exactly what users do |
| Tracks htmx requests/responses | Debug htmx apps easily |
| Monitors Fetch/XHR network calls | Catch API issues |
| Captures JavaScript errors | Never miss a bug |
| Exports logs as JSON | Share debug sessions |

**Installation:** Copy one file, add 3 lines of code. That's it.
